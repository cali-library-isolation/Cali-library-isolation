/* Performance gains are grabbed through following techniques:

   > hashing of needle.
   > hashing avoids scanning of duplicate entries in needle
     across the string.
   > unrolling when scanning for character in string
     across hash table.  */

/* Algorithm is as below:
   1. A empty hash table/dictionary is created comprising of
      256 ascii character set
   2. When hash entry is found in needle , the hash index
      is initialized to 1
   3. The string is scanned until end and for every character,
      its corresponding hash index is compared.
   4. initial length of string (count) until first hit of
      accept needle to be found is set to 0
   4. If hash index is set to 1 for the index of string,
      count is returned.
   5. Otherwise count is incremented and scanning continues
      until end of string.  */
