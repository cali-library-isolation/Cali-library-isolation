# DP: Description: i386 ld.so gets sigsegv when i686 optimized library is used,
#		   because the structure size of rtld_global and rtld_global_ro 
#		   are different due to HP_TIMING_AVAIL availability.
#		   This patch aligns those sizes for using i686 optimized library.

2005-03-03  GOTO Masanori  <gotom@debian.org>

	* sysdeps/generic/ldsodefs.h (struct rtld_global, rtld_global_ro):
	Include timing members if HP_TIMING_PAD is defined.

2005-01-02  GOTO Masanori  <gotom@debian.org>

	* elf/Makefile: Regenerate.

2003-10-12  Daniel Jacobowitz  <drow@mvista.com>

	* sysdeps/generic/ldsodefs.h (struct rtld_global): Include timing
	members if HP_TIMING_PAD is defined.
	* sysdeps/i386/hp-timing.h: New file.
