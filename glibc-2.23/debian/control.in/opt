Package: libc6-i686

Pre-Depends: libc6 (= ${binary:Version})
Depends: ${misc:Depends}
Build-Profiles: <!stage1>
Description: GNU C Library: Shared libraries [i686 optimized]
 Contains the standard libraries that are used by nearly all programs on
 the system. This package includes shared versions of the standard C
 library and the standard math library, as well as many others.
 .
 This set of libraries is optimized for i686 machines, and will only be
 used on an i686 class CPU (check the output of `uname -m').  This includes 
 Pentium Pro, Pentium II/III/IV, Celeron CPU's and similar class CPU's
 (including clones such as AMD Athlon/Opteron, VIA C3 Nehemiah, but not VIA 
 C3 Ezra).

Description: GNU C Library: Shared libraries [Xen version]
 Contains the standard libraries that are used by nearly all programs on
 the system. This package includes shared versions of the standard C
 library and the standard math library, as well as many others.
 .
 This set of libraries is optimized for the Xen hypervisor, and will be
 selected instead when running under Xen.

 Contains the standard libraries that are used by nearly all programs on
 the system. This package includes shared versions of the standard C
 library and the standard math library, as well as many others.
 .
 This set of libraries is optimized for the Alpha EV67. It only
 needs to be installed on Alpha EV67/68 and EV7 machines. If you install
 this on an older machine, it won't even be used.
