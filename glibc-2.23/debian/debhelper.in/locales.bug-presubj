locales dependencies on glibc
=============================

  If at some point (in unstable) you get messages like:

    The following packages have unmet dependencies:
      locales: Depends: glibc-2.6-1 which is a virtual package.

  then please check for example on [1] that the glibc of the _same_ version as
  the `locales` package you are trying to upgrade is in state _installed_ for
  your architecture, and for how long.

  If it's not, it is very likely that the corresponding libc has not been
  built _and_ uploaded to the mirrors for your architecture yet, and that the
  dependencies will be fixed soon. Please wait for the package to be installed
  for more than 24 hours before reporting a bug about `locales` dependencies.
